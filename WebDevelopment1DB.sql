(9, 2, 13, 'Pride and Prejudice is such a fun read! Elizabeth Bennet is witty, strong, and super relatable, and watching her go from disliking Mr. Darcy to falling in love with him is such a great journey. The chemistry between them is amazing, and I love how their story is about more than just romance – it’s also about overcoming misunderstandings and learning not to judge people too quickly. Austen’s humor and the way she portrays society’s pressures really make the book stand out. Definitely a must-read if you enjoy a mix of romance, drama, and clever dialogue.', 5, '2024-12-08 15:53:15'),
(10, 2, 14, 'I wasn’t sure what to expect from Pride and Prejudice, but it definitely surprised me. The book’s not just about the love story between Elizabeth and Darcy – it’s also about all the social drama and how people are constantly judging each other. Elizabeth’s a strong character, and Darcy’s transformation is actually pretty cool to watch. The whole “I hate you, but I actually love you” thing is a classic, but it still works well here. It’s not a super quick read, but it’s worth it if you like a bit of wit, romance, and a peek into 19th-century British society.', 4, '2024-12-08 15:54:48'),

He’s got money, parties, and the whole world at his feet, but he’s still chasing some chick who’s not even worth it. The whole thing’s just sad—showing how people can be fake and lost even when they got everything. It’s got that old-school 1920s vibe, but the story’s real enough to make you think. Definitely worth a read if you’re into that rich-people drama.', 3, '2024-12-08 16:01:24'),
(13, 2, 15, 'so this one’s all about love, but with some old-school drama. Elizabeth Bennet’s a strong woman who doesn’t fall for the first rich guy that comes her way, which is honestly kinda rare for the time. Mr. Darcy? Dude’s got a major ego at first, but he’s actually a softie under all that pride. The back-and-forth between them is like a constant game of cat and mouse. It’s slow-paced, but once you’re into it, the tension is real. If you’re cool with some fancy words and old vibes, you’ll see why this book’s a classic.', 4, '2024-12-08 16:02:49'),
(25, 2, 16, 'one of those books you can&#039;t help but fall in love with. The chemistry between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is so captivating, and their relationship grows in such an interesting way. I absolutely loved how witty and sharp the writing is, and the characters are all so well-crafted. It’s not just a romance, but a clever commentary on social expectations and class. I found myself laughing, getting frustrated, and cheering for Elizabeth as she navigates love and life. Definitely a book that stays with you long after you&#039;ve finished it!', 5, '2024-12-25 16:14:24'),
(26, 3, 16, ' is often praised for its symbolism and portrayal of the American Dream, I found it to be somewhat underwhelming. The characters, especially Gatsby himself, felt a bit one-dimensional, and I struggled to connect with their motivations. The story’s pacing was slow, and I often found myself frustrated by the superficiality of the characters&#039; actions. Although Fitzgerald’s writing is undeniably poetic, I felt the novel&#039;s overall message about wealth and desire lacked the depth I expected. It’s a book that’s clearly well-regarded, but for me, it didn’t live up to the hype.', 2, '2024-12-25 16:15:48');
